## Comments from the data source
The island of Atauro, formerly an administrative post (administrative level 2 feature) of the Dili administrative level 1 feature, became an independent administrative level 1 feature on 1 January 2022. This is not reflected in this COD-AB (or in the COD-PS).

Govt Decree Law No 16/2017 (31 March 2017) - created several new administrative level 3 units (sucos). GIS data is not yet available. The data included here for Admin level 3 are for information only and should not be considered official. Admin levels 0, 1, 2 are believed to be correct, except for the case of Atauro mentioned above.
